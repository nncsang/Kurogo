      Distributed Processing &amp; Network Management (DPNM) Lab.        &#13;
      Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH
    </title>
    <paragraph>  The Distributed Processing and Network Management Laboratory (DPNM, dpnm.postech.ac.kr) in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, founded by Prof. James Won-Ki Hong in 1995, is located in the POSTECH Information Research Laboratories. Prof. Hong is internationally recognized with his devotion to research activities in networking and distributed computing. He has published more than 100 international journal and conference papers. He has served numerous international positions including Technical Chair for IEEE ComSoc CNOM (www.comsoc.org/~cnom) from 1998 to 2000, Technical Program Co-chair for IEEE NOMS 2000 and APNOMS'99 (www.apnoms.org), and Finance Chair and Chair of local planning committee for IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2004 (www.noms2004.org). He is also an editorial advisory board member of International Journal on Network Management (IJNM) and Editor-in-Chief of KNOM Review Journal (www.knom.or.kr/knom-review/). He is currently serving as Vice Chair for IEEE ComSoc CNOM and Chair for KICS KNOM (www.knom.or.kr). Under his leadership and professionalism, DPNM has been emerged as one of the most active research laboratories in Korea as well as in the rest of the world.    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>DPNM has been working on two major research areas: networking and distributed computing.  With its remarkable reputation, DPNM has built very close relationships with industry. The DPNMï¿½ï¿½s project partners are listed from government-funded organizations such as ETRI, KOSEF, KREN, to multi-billion corporations such as Samsung, POSCO, KT, KTF, and POSDATA. Some of the projects even go abroad, like a recent contact from Quintessential IT Solutions, a wireless network solution provider in Australia. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>   In the networking area, DPNM is currently focusing on network and systems management. The goal is to develop methods, tools and systems that can be used for more efficient, secure and reliable operation and management of computer and telecommunication networks. DPNM is particularly interested in monitoring, analyzing and controlling IP networks. DPNMï¿½ï¿½s current projects include analyzing captured IP traffic for applications such as network security attack analysis, workload characterization, performance analysis, billing, SLA management, and customer relationship management.    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DPNMï¿½ï¿½s ingenuity and efforts finally led to the development of the Next Generation Traffic Monitoring System called NG-MON (ngmon.postech.ac.kr). Today, the bandwidth of ISP's backbone networks is evolving from OC-48 (2.5 Gbps) to OC-192 (10 Gbps) to support rapidly increasing Internet traffic. To cope with monitoring and analysis needs for multi-gigabit networks, the NG-MON project provides a scalable and cost-effective solution. For the design details, NG-MON subdivides the monitoring processes into multiple phases and distributes the processing load over them by allocating a system for each phase. If the distributed load in each phase is still beyond the capability of a single system, then it can be composed of a cluster of systems. NG-MONï¿½ï¿½s key features include the host throughput analysis, application traffic analysis (e.g., the ability to recognize multimedia and complex peer-to-peer application traffic), and security attack analysis (e.g., the ability to detect DoS/DDoS attacks, worms and viruses). </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>    In the distributed computing area, DPNM pays close attention to distributed computing environments and technologies (such as OMG CORBA, WWW, Web Services - SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, and XML), multimedia system services, and distributed systems and applications management.  The DPNMï¿½ï¿½s research objective in this area is to provide a secure, friendly and reliable computing environment for the development, operation and management of client-server, peer-to-peer, distributed applications in the presence of networked heterogeneous computing platforms.    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DPNM has worked for quite some time on XML-based network management systems (XNMS) and earned its reputation. XNMS allows the system administrator to manage and control IP network devices (e.g., routers, switches, gateways, DSLAMs, access points, and etc.) more conveniently and efficiently. The XML/SNMP gateway implemented within the XNMS project allows SNMP equipped devices to be managed by XNMS. DPNM is also an active participant of IETF standard efforts. Recently, DPNM has been working on contributing to the standardization of NETCONF, which is a protocol currently being proposed for configuration management of network devices using XML technologies.    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since joining POSTECH in 1995, Prof. Hong supervised and produced 32 M.S. and two Ph.D. graduates. The alumni of DPNM are the essential units and major driving force of Koreaï¿½ï¿½s research laboratories and commercial organizations. The diversity among DPNM members is another strong asset of this laboratory. DPNM has its members not only from Korea but also from all over the world like India, Canada, and U.S.A.    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with its extensive knowledge and experience with the IT and telecommunication industry, DPNM will continue to play a key role in research for innovative technologies in networking and distributed computing.            </paragraph>
